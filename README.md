# CodeAlpha_Calculator

This is a Basic calculator project which contains an input area to accept input from users, operations like add(+), subtract(-), multiply(*), division(/), equal(=) and some buttons which contains number from 0-9, '.' button, and clear(C) button. 

The basic structure of the calculator is created with HTML, then design is created with CSS and working of buttons is created with JavaScript. 

Using JavaScript, I have created syntax error functionality.
